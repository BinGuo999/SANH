This directory contains scripts used to generate domain_cfg.nc file, preprocess met forcing, set up paths and directories, auto-build tooling, XIOS and NEMO executables.

There were also Matlab scripts for initial conditions and boundary conditions. These are preserved on another branch, but have been replaced by python tooling.

Only the river forcing generating files have yet to be converted from matlab.

These remaining files should probably be tidied into STARTFILES under appropriate subdirectories, but there are paths that would be broken... Something for the to-do list.
